# Calendar App

## Overview

The **Calendar App** is a React-based application that allows users to manage their events. Users can view, add, edit, and delete events in a user-friendly interface. The application is designed to be responsive, performant, and easy to use. It is also well-tested, ensuring reliability and robustness.

## Features

- **Event Management:** Users can create, update, and delete events.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** The interface is designed with usability in mind, making it easy for users to navigate and manage their calendar.
- **Responsive Design:** The app is fully responsive, working seamlessly across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Optimized Performance:** The app is optimized for fast load times and smooth interactions.
- **Event Details:** Users can add detailed descriptions, set dates and times, and categorize events.

## Installation

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. **initiate the Repository:**
   ```
   npx create-react-app app-name
   cd calendar-app
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. Then, run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Application:**
   After the dependencies are installed, start the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
4. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/venkateswarareddychalla/calendar-app.git
    ```
   The app should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

1. **Viewing Events:** Navigate through the calendar to see the events scheduled for each day.
2. **Adding an Event:** Click on a date to add a new event. Fill in the event details and save it.
3. **Editing an Event:** Click on an existing event to edit its details.
4. **Deleting an Event:** Click on the delete button next to an event to remove it from the calendar.

## Testing

The Calendar App has been thoroughly tested to ensure its functionality and reliability. The testing strategy includes unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.

### 1. Unit Testing

- **Components:** All React components are tested individually to ensure they render correctly and handle user interactions as expected.
- **Functions:** Any utility functions used in the application are tested with a variety of inputs to confirm they return the correct outputs.

### 2. Integration Testing

- **Component Interaction:** Tests are written to ensure that components interact with each other correctly. For example, when a user adds an event, the event list should update accordingly.
- **State Management:** The app's state management is tested to confirm that state updates occur as intended, especially when events are added, edited, or deleted.

### 3. End-to-End Testing

- **User Flows:** Tests simulate real user interactions, such as navigating through the calendar, adding events, editing events, and deleting events. These tests verify that the app behaves correctly from a user perspective.
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility:** The app is tested across different browsers to ensure a consistent user experience.

### 4. Testing Tools and Frameworks

- **Jest:** Used for writing unit and integration tests.
- **React Testing Library:** Utilized for testing React components, focusing on testing components in a way that closely resembles how they are used by end users.
- **Cypress:** Used for end-to-end testing, simulating user interactions with the app and ensuring everything works as expected.

### Running Tests

To run the tests, use the following command:

```
npm test
```

This will run all unit and integration tests. For end-to-end tests, ensure you have Cypress installed and configured, then run:

```
npx cypress open
```

This command will open the Cypress Test Runner, allowing you to run the end-to-end tests.
